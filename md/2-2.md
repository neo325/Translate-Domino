The FORM tag contains arguments that tell the browser how to submit the completed form:</br>
1.The METHOD argument tells the browser to construct an HTTP “post” request.</br>
2.The ACTION argument tells the browser the URL to which it must direct the submission. The URL has three parts: 
  the database, a hex number representing the universal ID (UNID) of the form, and the action to be performed (CreateDocument).</br>
3.The ENCTYPE argument indicates the MIME-type in which the data is to be formatted. (MIME is an Internet standard for message and 
  data formatting.)</br>
4.The NAME argument indicates the name of the form. The name is provided for the use of any JavaScript that might be included on the form.
  The NAME argument will be the actual form name if it is a valid JavaScript identifier. If the form name is not a valid JavaScript identifier, 
  (for example, our form name “Research Report” has an embedded space), Domino will use the generic value “_DominoForm.”</br>
  
So, when Susan clicks the Submit button, the browser constructs an HTTP “post” request, adds the formatted data, and sends the 
complete request to the specified URL. The exact format of the request differs slightly among browsers. In Figure 4, I show a sample 
post request for Susan’s Research Report form.</br>

After Domino receives the post request, it creates a new document in the database. Susan can then go to a view and look at this document
in her browser (Figure 5).</br>
